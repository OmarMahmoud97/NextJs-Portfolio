### My portfolio website showcases my design and development skills, as it was created using Figma for design and then crafted with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Greensock for animations.

### To bring the designs to life, I utilized Blender for 3D modeling and visual effects.

### The result is a sleek, professional website that truly showcases my abilities and makes a strong first impression for potential clients and employers.
